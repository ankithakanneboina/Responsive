# 📰 Responsive Blog Layout 

A modern and elegant **responsive blog layout** built using **only HTML and CSS**, featuring a clean grid design, responsive typography, and a **Dark/Light mode** toggle — no JavaScript needed!

## 🌟 Overview

This project showcases how to create a **responsive blog homepage** using **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox**.  
Each post is presented as a card with:

The layout automatically adjusts to different screen sizes — from desktop (3 cards per row) to tablet (2 per row) to mobile (1 per row).
